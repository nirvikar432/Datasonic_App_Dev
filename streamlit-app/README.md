## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- SQL Server database access
- Azure Blob Storage account
- Computer Vision API endpoint
- Machine Learning API for premium prediction

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Datasonic_App_Dev/streamlit-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_SERVER=your_sql_server.database.windows.net
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Azure Blob Storage
AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_azure_connection_string
AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME=your_container_name

# API Endpoints
API_URL=your_document_extraction_api_url
API_CODE=your_api_access_code
CV_ENDPOINT=your_computer_vision_api_url
ML_PREMIUM_API=your_ml_premium_prediction_api
ML_PREMIUM_BEARER=your_bearer_token

# Optional: Logging and Monitoring
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### 4. Database Setup
Ensure your SQL Server database has the required tables:
- `New_Policies`
- `New_Claims` 
- `Documents`
- `App_Log`
- `Brokers`
- `Insurers`

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage Guide

### Policy Management
1. **New Policy Creation**: Navigate to "New Submission" tab
2. **Document Upload**: Drag and drop policy documents
3. **Automated Processing**: System extracts key fields automatically
4. **Premium Prediction**: ML model calculates optimal premium
5. **Review & Submit**: Validate data and create policy record

### Claims Processing
1. **Claim Registration**: Create new claim entries
2. **Document Upload**: Upload claim documents and damage photos
3. **Damage Analysis**: AI analyzes vehicle damage automatically
4. **Severity Assessment**: System provides risk evaluation
5. **Dashboard Review**: Monitor claim status and analytics

### Damage Assessment Workflow
